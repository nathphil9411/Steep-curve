# Steep-curve

Welcome to the Simple Web Development Projects repository on GitHub! This repository is dedicated to hosting various simple web development projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Whether you're a beginner looking to start practice your web development skills or or stuggling from tutorial hell, this is for you. 
Project Structure
Each project is organized in its own folder, with a clear and concise name indicating the project's focus. Inside each project folder, you will find the following files:

index.html: The main HTML file that represents the structure of the web page.
style.css: The CSS file containing styles and layout instructions for the web page.
script.js: The JavaScript file, where interactive elements and functionality are implemented.
Getting Started
To get started with these projects, you can either download the entire repository or clone it using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/https://github.com/nathphil9411/Steep-curve.git
Once you have the repository on your local machine, navigate to the specific project's folder of your choice and open the index.html file in your preferred web browser. You can then experiment with the code, modify it, and see how changes affect the web page.
